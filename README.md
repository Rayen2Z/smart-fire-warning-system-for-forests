# A Smart Fire Warning System for Forests
A mini-project as an application of data collection and analysis: fire warning system in a forest

A simulation of a communication channel between a server and temperature sensors in fire lookout towers (PCs and Rasberry Pi) to analyze the temperatures and generate a fire alert in case of a threshold overrun.
