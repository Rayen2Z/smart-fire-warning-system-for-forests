# ðŸŒ³ðŸ”¥ A Smart Fire Warning System for Forests ðŸ”¥ðŸŒ²

The Fire Warning System in a Forest is a mini-project that focuses on data collection and analysis for fire detection and prevention. The project simulates a server running on a PC and multiple fire lookout towers represented by Raspberry Pi devices. The objective is to establish a communication channel between the server and the Raspberry Pi devices, collecting real-time temperature data from the lookout towers.

The collected temperature data is then analyzed to detect any instances where the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating a potential fire hazard. In such cases, the system generates an alert or notification to prompt appropriate actions for fire prevention and control.

To enhance usability and decision-making, the project includes a web application. The web app presents a user-friendly interface to visualize the historical temperature data collected from the lookout towers. Users can explore temperature trends, view statistics, and gain valuable insights into fire risk factors within the forest.

By leveraging data collection, analysis, and the simulation of a communication channel, the Fire Warning System provides an effective means of monitoring and addressing fire risks. The combination of the server simulation, Raspberry Pi devices, and the web app empowers forest management personnel to proactively mitigate fire hazards and implement timely fire prevention strategies.

This mini-project serves as a practical demonstration of data science techniques in the context of fire warning systems. It showcases the use of simulated server-client communication, temperature analysis, and web-based visualization to support informed decision-making and facilitate efficient fire prevention measures in forest environments.
